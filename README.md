# Background
Codeforces is a project joining people interested in and taking part in programming contests. On one hand, Codeforces is a social network dedicated to programming and programming contests. On the other hand, it is a platform where contests are held regularly, the participant's skills are reflected by their rating and the former contests can be used to prepare. (part from codeforces.com)

On Codeforces, some educational rounds are hosted, which different from general rounds. Education ones is a good choice to improve programming skill.

# What is it?

This project can crawl information related to education contests from Codeforces and generate a .xlsx file  to hold result. Alternatively, you could modify the codes and hold the result by any means you want.

# How to use it?

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

After the program runs, a file called "results.xlsx" will be generated in the root directory of the project, which contains the information about name, link, and time of all education contests up to now.
